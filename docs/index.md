## Quick Start

Install the Go Composer SDK:

```bash
go get github.com/scagogogo/go-composer-sdk
```

Create a Composer instance and start managing PHP dependencies:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    
    "github.com/scagogogo/go-composer-sdk/pkg/composer"
)

func main() {
    // Create a Composer instance with default options
    comp, err := composer.New(composer.DefaultOptions())
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create Composer instance: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Check if Composer is installed
    if !comp.IsInstalled() {
        log.Fatal("Composer is not installed")
    }
    
    // Get Composer version
    version, err := comp.GetVersion()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to get Composer version: %v", err)
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Composer version: %s\n", version)
    
    // Install dependencies
    err = comp.Install(false, false) // noDev=false, optimize=false
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to install dependencies: %v", err)
    }
    
    fmt.Println("Dependencies installed successfully!")
}
```
